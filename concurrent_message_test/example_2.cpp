/*
While the pushBack method is used by the threads to add data to the monitor
incrementally, the main thread uses printSize at the end to display all the
results at once. Our goal is to change the code in a way that the main thread
gets notified every time new data becomes available. But how can the main thread
know whether new data has become available? The solution is to write a new
method that regularly checks for the arrival of new data.

In the code listed below, a new method dataIsAvailable() has been added while
printIDs() has been removed. This method returns true if data is available in
the vector and false otherwise. Once the main thread has found out via
dataIsAvailable() that new data is in the vector, it can call the method
popBack() to retrieve the data from the monitor object. Note that instead of
copying the data, it is moved from the vector to the main method.

Image

In the main thread, we will use an infinite while-loop to frequently poll the
monitor object and check whether new data has become available. Contrary to
before, we will now perform the read operation before the workers are done - so
we have to integrate our loop before wait() is called on the futures at the end
of main(). Once a new Vehicle object becomes available, we want to print it
within the loop.

When we execute the code, we get a console output similar to the one listed
below:

Image

From the output it can easily be seen, that adding and removing to and from the
monitor object is now interleaved. When executed repeatedly, the order of the
vehicles will most probably differ between executions.
